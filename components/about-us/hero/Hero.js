              In Arabic, Ihsan means ‘perfection’ or ‘excellence’. It’s a matter
              of taking one’s inner faith, and showing it both in deeds and
              actions. It’s a sense of social responsibility, born from
              religious convictions. It’s the Mulim responsibility to strive for
              perfection, constituting the highest form of worship.

              When it comes to coaching or therapy, traditional coaches may be
              unfamiliar with fundamental religious statuses like Ihsan. We
              bridge that gap for the Islam community.

              society and empathize through shared backgrounds and perspectives,
