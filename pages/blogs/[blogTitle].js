Parents often normalize unhealthy parent-child dynamics and adopt harmful practices due to cultural upbringing. Just because they might have been raised in a certain way does not mean they should repeat the cycle. Cultural norms change country by country, and children may not relate to back home practices. Parents often focus on a child’s physical well-being, but tend to forget their mental well-being. They work hard to provide the best lifestyle for their child, but it often comes at the cost of building a strong and healthy relationship. Parents strive to give their children the world, yet at times fail to understand that what they really need is empathy and love.",

Therefore, we do everything we can to try and provide our children with the best education both academically and religiously. However, children are observational learners and are mostly influenced by our actions. No matter how good of an education a parent may give their child, if the relationship is strained and toxic, the child is more susceptible to self-destructive behaviors. Therefore, it should be a priority that we, as parents, ensure that we are the best version of ourselves.

Parents often try to learn as they go and make many mistakes on the way; however, this can cause a lot of harm to the child. Parent coaching becomes substantially more crucial when a child has begun exhibiting behavioral issues such as excessive disobedience, aggression, or drug use. Parents don’t always know what to do in these situations and might make it worse. Instead of understanding and helping their child, they may alienate them even further. Therefore, it is best to consult with a parent coach to help them think clearly and not act on emotion. Even guidance on electronics, friends or discipline can be sought through parent coaching.
